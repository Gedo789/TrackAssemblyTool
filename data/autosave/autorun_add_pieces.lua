 Create a table and populate it as shown below
 In the square brackets goes your model,
 and then for every active point you must have one array of
 strings, where the elements match the following data settings.
 You can use the reverse sign event /@/ to reverse any component of the
 parameterization and also the disable event /#/ to make TA auto-fill
 the value provided
 {TYPE, NAME, LINEID, POINT, ORIGIN, ANGLE, CLASS}
 TYPE   > This string is the name of the type your stuff will reside in the panel
          Disabling this, makes it use the value of the /DEFAULT_TYPE/ variable
          If it is emty uses the string /TYPE/, so make sure you fill this
 NAME   > This is the name of your track piece. Put /#/ here to be auto-generated form
          the model ( from the last slash to the file extension )
 LINEID > This is the ID of the point that can be selected for building. They must be
          sequential
 POINT  > This is the position vector that TA searhes and selects.
          An empty string is treated as the ORIGIN.
          Disabling this using the disable event makes it hidden when the active point is searched for
 ORIGIN > This is the origin relative to which the next track piece position is calculated
          An empty string is treated as {0,0,0}. Disabling this makes it non-selectable by the holder
 ANGLE  > This is the angle relative to which the forward and up vectors are calculated.
          An empty string is treated as {0,0,0}. Disabling this also makes it use {0,0,0}
 CLASS  > This string is filled up when your entity class is not /prop_physics/ but something else
          used by ents.Create of the gmod ents api library. Keep this empty if your stuff is a normal prop
